angel is a simple, command line file integrity checker written in ruby

seemed like a fun friday-night project
chmod +x angel.rb to make your life easier...

1. specify mysql username and pass in .angel.conf file.
2. add absolute paths of files you'd like to have checked to .angel.conf.
3. perform initial scan with ./angel.rb init
4. perform file integrity check using ./angel.rb scan whenever you get paranoid (perhaps in cron job?)

TODO:

1. switch out puts for actual Logger warnings
3. add notification support -- twitter? email? something.
4. rip various bits into separate files (no longer planning to daemonize)
