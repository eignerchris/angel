angel is a ludicrously simple command line file integrity checker written in ruby -- seemed like a fun friday-night project

to get started...

sudo gem install dm-core
sudo gem install dm-validations
sudo gem install dm-timestamps

optionally 'chmod +x angel.rb' to make life a bit easier

1. create mysql db named 'angel'
2. create ~/.angel.conf file. see included example conf file.
3. add absolute paths of files or dirs you'd like to have checked to .angel.conf. angel will recursively check all files in a dir
4. initialize db with './angel.rb init'

perform file integrity check at any time using './angel.rb scan' (perhaps in cron job?)
re-populate db at anytime by re-running './angel.rb init'
optionally redirect stdout to file for logging purposes, e.g. 'ruby angel.rb scan > angel.log'

TODO:
1. switch out 'puts' for actual Logger warnings
2. add notification support -- twitter? email? something.
