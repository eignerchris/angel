angel is a simple, command line file integrity checker written in ruby
seemed like a fun friday-night project

dependent on:
dm-core
dm-validations
dm-timestamps

sudo gem install dm-core
 "    "     "    dm-validations
 "    "     "    dm-timestamps


chmod +x angel.rb to make your life easier...

1. create mysql db named 'angel'
2. create and fill in ~/.angel.conf file. see included example conf file.
2. add absolute paths of files or dirs you'd like to have checked to .angel.conf. angel will recursively check all files in a dir
3. perform initial scan with './angel.rb init'
done!


perform file integrity check at any time using './angel.rb scan' (perhaps in cron job?)
optionally redirect stdout to file for logging purposes, e.g. './angel.rb scan > angel.log' 

TODO:
1. switch out puts for actual Logger warnings
3. add notification support -- twitter? email? something.
4. rip various bits into separate files (no longer planning to daemonize)
